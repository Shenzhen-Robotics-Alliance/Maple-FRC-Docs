## Hello there 👋🏻

A warm welcome to the programming documentation of FRC Team 5516 "IRON MAPLE"🍁.

This documentation is a comprehensive guide📖 intended to familiarize our new members with the programming aspect of our activities. 

If you're a freshman in our team, you're in the right place!🎉.  This is where you'll find everything you need to get started with FRC programming and to become an integral part of our team. We encourage you to explore, learn, and ask questions💡.  Don't hesitate to reach out to your fellow seniors - we're all here to help.

But this isn't just for our team members. If you're a freshman from another team who has stumbled upon this documentation, we extend our warm welcome to you too🤝🏻. We believe in the spirit of [Coopertition](https://www.firstinspires.org/node/20896) and would like to share our work with entire FIRST community. We hope you find this documentation helpful in your coding  journey.

Welcome aboard⛵,  and happy coding! 💻
