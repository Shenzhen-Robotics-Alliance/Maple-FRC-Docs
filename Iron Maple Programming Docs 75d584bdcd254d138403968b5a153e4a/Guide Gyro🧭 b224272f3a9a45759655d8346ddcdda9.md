# What are gyros?

Gyro is a type of sensor that can sense the rotation of a robot.

It is like the compass of the robot, and is crucial to the navigation of a robot. 

# Types of Gyros

- **Digital Compass** senses the absolute heading of the robot (eg. north-west)
    
    
    Advantage: Does not need calibration.
    
    Disadvantage: Possibly interfered by magnet field of electric motors
    
- **IMU** senses the amount of change in heading of the robot since the start of the match. (used more commonly)
    
    
    Advantage: stable, steady.
    
    Disadvantage: Needs calibration at the start of the match; may drift away from calibrated direction.
    

# The Gyro Interface

In previous sessions we have learned about the Drivers in our code base.  It contains code that interacts with the hardware.  Gyros can also be accessed from Drivers.

### Creating a Gyro Instance

```java
/* creates a simple gyro using Nav2X hardware */
private final SimpleGyro gyro1 = new SimpleGyro(
	0, // yaw axis is has index 0 (this means that the gyro is lying down on the robot)
	true, // yaw axis is reversed;  we define counter-clockwise as positive so yaw axis is reversed for the sensors that thinks clockwise is positive
	new NavX2IMU() // create a Nav2X instance
);

/* creates a simple gyro using Pigeon2 hardware */
private final SimpleGyro gyro2 = new SimpleGyro(
	0, // yaw axis is has index 0 (this means that the gyro is lying down on the robot)
	true, // yaw axis is NOT reversed
	new PigeonsIMU(0) // create a Pigeon2 instance with CanID 0
);
```

### Setting the Zero-Position (Origin)

```java
// set the current rotation as Zero-Position
// this will immediately make the reading of the gyro 0, and will continue to accumulate based on that
gyro.reset();

// set the current rotation as a 90 degrees
// this will immediately make the reading of the gyro 90 degrees, and will continue to accumulate based on that
gyro.calibrate(Math.toRadians(90))
```

### Reading the Heading of the Robot

```java
gyro.getYaw(); // returns the current reading of the gyro, in radians (0~2Pi)
gyro.getYawVelocity(); // returns the current angular velocity of the robot (think of it as "how fast the robot is turning")
```
